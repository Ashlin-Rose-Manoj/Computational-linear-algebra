# **Python Fundamentals**

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers. Over the years, Python has undergone significant development and improvement, with major releases adding new features and optimizations. The language’s versatility and ease of use have made it popular in various domains, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and more. Python’s extensive standard library and active community contribute to its widespread adoption, making it one of the most popular programming languages in the world today.

# Printing text
print("Hello, World!")

# Printing multiple values
x = 5
y = 10
print("The value of x is:", x, "and the value of y is:", y)

# Assigning values to variables
a = 10
b = 20.5
name = "Alice"

# Printing the values
print("Values Stored in the Variables:")
print(a)
print(b)
print(name)

# Taking input from the user
name = input("Enter usr name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# Taking numerical input
age = int(input("Enter usr age: "))
print("us are", age, "years old.")

# Program to calculate the sum of two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Calculate sum
sum = num1 + num2

# Display the result
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum)
